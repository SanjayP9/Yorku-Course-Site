# YorkU-Course-Site
<b> Scrapes course names off York's Current Student's Website for easier viewing without jumping through so many hoops </b>

<b> To-Dos: </b>
<ul>
  <li>Allow people to custom search courses (use of scanner?) and check if it's offered in certain sessions (ex: Fall/Winter/Summer)</li>
  <li>Display courses in a simple format (or at least allow the user to view multiple course sections in new tabs/same page)</li>
  <li>Add courses that are not available on York's w2prod site</li>
  <li>Display recently searched courses</li>
</ul>
